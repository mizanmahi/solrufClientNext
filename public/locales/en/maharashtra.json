    "Maharashtra is located in the western part of India with the third largest state area in Maharashtra. The installed solar capacity of Maharashtra is 40.9 GW commissioned solar energy in 2021. Maharashtra approved its solar energy policy in January 2016, encouraging both public and private entities to go solar. In addition to this, the Civic Development authorities were asked to ensure that construction permission is only given to those buildings, government colonies, etc who pledge to install solar at rooftop. The Maharashtra State Cabinet has issued its ‘Unconventional Energy Generation Policy’ to promote non-conventional source-based energy generation. These include implementation of 100,000 agricultural solar pumps, 52,000 kV of rooftop solar systems, 2,000 solar water supply stations, the electrification of 10,000 rural homes, microgrid projects for 20 homes, 55,000 square feet of solar water/solar cooking systems, and 800 solar cold-storage projects.": "Maharashtra is located in the western part of India with the third largest state area in Maharashtra.
